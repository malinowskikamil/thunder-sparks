title: Charging an Electric Car at home

You can charge an electric car at home using a dedicated home charging point (a standard 3 pin plug with an EVSE cable should only be used as a last resort).

* Electric car drivers choose a home charging point to benefit from faster charging speeds and built-in safety features.
* Charging an electric car is like charging a mobile phone - plug in overnight and top up during the day.
* It's useful to have a 3 pin charging cable as a backup charging option, but they are not designed to withstand these loads and should not be used long term.

**How to charge an electric car at home**

To charge an electric car at home, you will need a home charging point installed where you park your electric car, or an EVSE supply cable for a 3 pin plug socket as an occasional back up.

* Drivers usually choose a dedicated home charging point because it's faster and has built-in safety features.
* A home charging point is a compact weatherproof unit that mounts to a wall with a connected charging cable or a socket for plugging in a portable charging cable.
* Dedicated home charging points are installed by qualified specialist installers like Pod Point.

**How fast you can charge an electric car at home**

Charging speed for electric cars is measured in kilowatts (kW).

Home charging points charge your car at 3.7kW or 7kW giving about 15-30 miles of range per hour of charge (compared to 2.3kW from a 3 pin plug which provides up to 8 miles of range per hour).

**How to get an electric car charging point installed at home**

Electric car charging points need to be professionally installed. A certified charging provider will include installation cost in the price of the unit.

* The installation process involves wall mounting the chargepoint on an exterior wall or garage, near to where you park and connecting it safely to the mains electricity supply.
* An installation should take around three hours to complete, depending on the individual requirements of the driver and the complexity of the installation.
* Installations can be via e-mail or the phone

**How often should you charge an electric car at home**

You can charge your electric car at home as often you need to. It can be treated the same as charging a mobile phone, fully charging overnight and topping up in the day if necessary.

While it is not necessary for most to charge every day, many drivers plug in each time they leave their car out of habit, giving them maximum flexibility should they have to make an unexpected journey.

* By charging overnight, electric car drivers can take advantage of cheap nighttime electricity rates and drive for as little as 2p per mile.
* Overnight charging also ensures that the carâ€™s battery is full each morning for the day ahead.
* Most drivers also make use of charging facilities at their work place or public destinations to top up charge.
